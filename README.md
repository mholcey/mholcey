- 👋 Hi there! I'm Michelle Holcey. I am a seasoned professional with 25 years in the travel industry from government, military, leisure and corporate travel to becoming a developer for the automation of travel. My first programming language that I learned for my job was Visual Basic. Since then, I decided to learn Python, SQL and a variety of other skills. I have seriously been on an upskilling binge!  

Summer of 2020 ~ I completed the following courses on Udemy, edX and Coursera just to name a few:

CompTIA Security + SYO-501 (Total Seminars with Mike Myers)
Amazon Web Services - Certified Cloud Practitioner
Salesforce modules ranging from Administrator to Email Marketing and Marketing Cloud Developer
SQL Certified Developer from W3Schools
PYO101EN Python Basics for Data Science using IBM Watson Studio on edX
University of Michigan's "Python for Everybody" on Coursera
Google IT Technical Support Fundamentals

I am currently enrolled in the Springboard Data Analytics Career Track, which consists of 400+ hours of hands-on course material, with 1:1 industry expert mentor oversight, and completion of 2 in-depth capstone projects. Mastering skills in analyzing business problems, data analysis, presenting business insights to different stakeholders, SQL, Python, and data visualization. 

- 👀 I recently created some Vizzes that you can view on Tableau Public using this link: https://public.tableau.com/profile/michelle.holcey8178#!/

- 🌱 I'm a novice Data Analyst obtaining a certification from Springboard. In this course I've been gaining advanced skills in Microsoft Excel, 
as well as growing deeper knowledge of SQL and Python and even gaining new skills such as Tableau, Power BI, Data Analytics and Presentation skills. 

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some projects using SQL, Python and Tableau to showcase skills as well as tell the story that data provides.

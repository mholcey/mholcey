- üëã Hi there! I'm Michelle Holcey. I am pivoting my career as a result of the Covid Pandemic. I spent 25 years in the travel industry, with the most recent 2 years as a
software developer (programming with Visual Basic proprietary to the company) for the automation of travel for a travel management firm. 

Fun fact that some may not realize is that travel agents acutally use many different coding 
languages to speak to the platform that is used for each global distribution systems (network system used to book travel). Sabre was my "coding language" that I used for 
over 20 years and also have familiarity with Apollo, Worldspan and Galileo and Amadeus. 

Summer of 2020 ~ I decided to take some courses on Udemy, edX and Coursera to broaden my skillset and knowledge base for possible new career opportunities in the Technology field.
The following areas were of interest to me, so these are the skills that I decided to gain certiicates in, or complete modules or even just complete the course bootcmps:

CompTIA Security + SYO-501 (Total Seminars with Mike Myers)
Amazon Web Services - Certified Cloud Practitioner
Salesforce modules ranging from Administrator to Email Marketing and Marketing Cloud Developer
SQL Certified Developer from W3Schools
PYO101EN Python Basics for Data Science using IBM Watson Studio on edX
University of Michigan's "Python for Everybody" on Coursera
Google IT Technical Support Fundamentals

Which lead me to where I am currently which is a Data Analytics Fellow with Springboard (6 month immersive course) I complete the course June 2021:

Springboard Data Analytics Career Track consists of 400+ hours of hands-on course material, with 1:1 industry expert mentor oversight, and completion of 2 in-depth 
capstone projects. Mastering skills in analyzing business problems, data analysis, presenting business insights to different stakeholders, SQL, Python, and data visualization.

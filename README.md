Summer of 2020 ~ I was on an education binge and really enjoyed learning and working in different hands-on workshops! Here are a few of them ~ 

CompTIA Security + SYO-501 (Total Seminars with Mike Myers)
Amazon Web Services - Certified Cloud Practitioner
Salesforce modules ranging from Administrator to Email Marketing and Marketing Cloud Developer
SQL Certified Developer from W3Schools
PYO101EN Python Basics for Data Science using IBM Watson Studio on edX
University of Michigan's "Python for Everybody" on Coursera
Google IT Technical Support Fundamentals

I received my Certificate from Springboard for the completion of their Data Analytics Career Track, which consists of 400+ hours of hands-on course material, with 1:1 industry expert mentor oversight, and completion of 2 in-depth capstone projects. Mastering skills in analyzing business problems, data analysis, presenting business insights to different stakeholders, SQL, Python, and data visualization. This course was intense but very worth every penny of the cost to further invest in myself. It was a 6 month long bootcamp that I started December 2020 and completed May 2021.

I created Vizzes in Tableau Public. You can view with this link: https://public.tableau.com/profile/michelle.holcey8178#!/

- 🌱 I'm now completing my Salesforce Administrator curriculum in order to become CERTIFIED. Once I obtain certification, I will volunteer to work for a non-profit in order to gain experience and create new connections and get a real feel for the day in the life of a Salesforce Admin.

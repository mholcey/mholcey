I am a Rad Women Grad! I created a GitHub account under michelle-rad. I created a dozen gists while learning how to read Apex Code and write triggers and classes. I also used that account to work on SFDX projects and other work related projects. My work repo was tied to that account, and I have lost access. I'm hopefule to rectify this and gain access soon! In the meantime ~ here i am!üëä 

A little bit about my background, and what got me to this ~ my very first GitHubü§ñ account (back in 2020)... It all started when the pandemic hit. Yup, I'm the product of a Covid-induced-career-pivot. I was in the travel industry for 25 years in total‚≠êÔ∏è. The last couple of years I was a developer for the automation of travel. I worked with Concur GDSX Remote Desktop and the code language was much like Visual Basic. The years before that I booked complex internation travel for various companies and handled everything from VIP, Government, Military (yes there is a difference), Leisure, and Corporate Travel. I've worked in places such as West Point (USMA) to Hunter Army Airfield (HAAF) and Ft. Stewart. 

Currently, I reside in Savannah, GA and have worked on some pretty fun projects! A very smart, caring, supportive, mentor / colleague of mine taught me a bit about DevOps. We worked together on a project that we built to automate ‚ö°Ô∏èour packaged release post-install steps using tasks in cci (cumulusCI). I used Visual Studio Code to build out these tasks and flows, then in Github a workflow action for the customer sandboxes that I wanted to run these tasks in. I cannot describe the feeling I had when I saw that green checkmark showing SUCCESS!üèÜ

I am passionate when it comes to challengesü•á. I enjoy collaborating and brainstorming with colleagues. I desire success for my peers and the company that I work for. I possess the spirit and attitude for success, with empathy, excellent organization/communication skills and work ethic. I'm very ambitious and excited to showcase my valuable skills that I've gained from 25 years in my career, as well as maintain qualifications, certifications and continuously grow with the ever-changing technology.üôå

About that Covid-induced-career-pivot...
Summer of 2020 ~ I was on a professional development BINGE and really wanted to learn some skills that would add value to my soft skillset. 
Here is what I tackled and the Certifications I obtained ~ 

CompTIA Security + SYO-501 (Total Seminars with Mike Myers) I failed this exam.. and without a job, it was too pricey to retake :/
Amazon Web Services - AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner
Salesforce modules for Email Marketing and Marketing Cloud Developer (modules completed but did not take the $$ exams)
SQL Certified Developer from W3Schools
PYO101EN Python Basics for Data Science using IBM Watson Studio on edX
University of Michigan's "Python for Everybody" on Coursera
Google IT Technical Support Fundamentals
Salesforce Admininistrator Trailhed (including the 3 superbadges) - Certified Salesforce Administrator (This one I took the exam and passed!! without having worked in Salesforce)

Also, I attended a bootcamp and received a Certificate from Springboard for the completion of their Data Analytics Career Track. This consisted of 400+ hours of hands-on course material, with 1:1 industry expert mentor oversight, and completion of 2 in-depth capstone projects. Mastering skills in analyzing business problems, data analysis, presenting business insights to different stakeholders, SQL, Python, and data visualization. This course was intense but very worth every penny of the cost to further invest in myself. It was a 6 month long program that I started December 2020 and completed May 2021 (excelerated). As my Capstone project ~ I created Vizzes in Tableau Public. You can view with this link: https://public.tableau.com/profile/michelle.holcey8178#!/

- üå± I'm now working on growing my Apex Development skills, and just watched the Apex Academy courses by David K Liu. These are actually retired courses in Pluralsight.
      I'm also shooting to study for the Platform App Builder Cert next! Then, will go for Platform Dev I and II after that! I really do enjoy Github and Automation tools so of 
      course I hope to work on future projects like the ones I have been doing recently!
